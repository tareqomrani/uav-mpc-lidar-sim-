‚úàÔ∏è UAV LiDAR + MPC Lab

A lightweight, interactive multi-agent UAV simulator that blends LiDAR sensing with Model Predictive Control (MPC) for real-time obstacle avoidance, tasking, and coordination. Runs in a browser via Streamlit.

‚ú® Highlights
	‚Ä¢	Multi-drone 2-D world with bouncing moving obstacles
	‚Ä¢	LiDAR ray-casting with coverage along beams (not just hits)
	‚Ä¢	MPC navigation with separation penalties and wind/gusts
	‚Ä¢	Goal behaviors: damped hover or circular Loiter Mode
	‚Ä¢	Arrival metrics: time-to-goal and speed at first arrival
	‚Ä¢	Playback mode: step-by-step animation or instant final snapshot
	‚Ä¢	Performance tools: Fast Mode, decimated plotting, batched beam drawing
	‚Ä¢	AI Suggestions: dynamic, data-driven tips based on coverage, latency, separation, battery, and speeds
	‚Ä¢	One-click exports: CSVs, JSON, PNG, GeoJSON, and full ZIP bundle
